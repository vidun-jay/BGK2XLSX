BGK2XLSX is a Python-based tool that extracts gene information from GenBank files and converts it into an Excel file format (.xlsx), making it easier to analyze and manipulate genomic data in a spreadsheet.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/vidun-jay/BGK2XLSX/releases).
2. Download the `BGK2XLSX.exe` file and run BGK2XLSX on your system.

## Usage
1. Open the BGK2XLSX application from your desktop or Start Menu.
2. Drag and drop your GenBank file into the terminal window or follow the on-screen prompt to enter the file path.
3. The program will process the GenBank file and generate an Excel file named `gene_data.xlsx` in the same directory.

⚠️ **Note:** Ensure that your GenBank file is properly formatted for accurate data extraction.

## Configuration
BGK2XLSX saves the converted Excel file in the current working directory. Simply run the tool, and it will handle the rest.
